01. Installed discord.js npm package

02. Changed the "main" value in the package.json file to "src/index.js",
    since we will put all the files inside the src folder
    This sets the default main file location

03. The login token was taken from the discord developer portal

04. We can use nodemon to run the server

05. Created an event listener for the event "ready" and "message"

06. We can access any message and the all details related to that and reply accordingly
